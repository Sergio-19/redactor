            <p> Designed for ascending a rope
        Simple to use, and effective:
        - ergonomic molded handle allows a comfortable yet powerful grip
        - wide opening allows the handle to be easily grasped, even with thick gloves.
        - ergonomic upper part to maximize power when pulling with two hands
        - safety catch is totally integrated into the body of the ascender to help prevent snagging
        - toothed cam with self-cleaning slot optimizes performance under any conditions (frozen or dirty ropes...)
        - wide lower hole allows the carabiners of the CONNECT ADJUST lanyard and FOOTAPE or FOOTCORD footloop to be easily attached
        - upper hole for clipping a carabiner around the rope
        Available in left-handed and right-handed versions</p>
